2). What are neural networks?

- A network of interconnected nodes, each with "weights" and "biases" and data flows through it from input to output.
- Neural networks are a set of algorithms designed to recognise patterns. Check out Tensorflow's mmist problem
- The name is derived from their structure modelled around the human brain.
- Several layers; each containing operations to process inputs, or map pathways through the network to produce outputs.
- We'll focus mostly on the network layers ("dense" or "connected") and take a look at operations in the next section.


- These layers consist of mini networks of many interconnected nodes, each with assigned "weights" and "biases".
- Weights are assigned an initial value and are altered according to an activation function during training.
- Biases are just some constant value assigned to each node.
- The weight of each connection determines which path to take once a node receives an input, repeated until the end.
- What this means for us is that the image runs through the network until patterns are recognised.
- We get similar images consistently mapping to the final output node, even if the middle of the pathway is different.
- For example, if our model tries to recognise whether or not an image contains a face, each image with a face will:
  after training; take similar (albeit not identical) pathways through the network.
- Image classification is all about recognising patterns consistent to all images of a category.
- Our models learn the pathways and adjust neuron weights during training to build said pathways.




Basically decision maths. They each have their own weightings and bias. Example
