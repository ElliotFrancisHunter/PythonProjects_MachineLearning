What is machine learning?

- Machine learning describes a machine's (computer program's) ability to learn and improve from experience.
- If a program yields a net improvement in it's results without being explicitly programmed, it is said to have learned.
- Programs will get better at performing their task with increased exposure to relevant data and further training.
- We use machine learning in: Optimisation, prediction and classification scenarios.
- Examples: Stock market prediction, image recognition.
- There a plenty of machine learning algorithms we can use, each with their own strengths and weaknesses
- We will be using a CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK for image classification(using KERAS) trained under "Supervised learning"

 There are 4 main steps to building a machine learning model:
 - Processing the data
 - Building a model
 - Training the model
 - Testing the model

- Processing the data:
    The more relevant data the model has been fed, the more accurate it can be.
    We first gather a lot of relevant data that is useful for training our model.
    We then have to process the data so it is all in the same format and can easily be interpreted by our model.
    Generally, the data is divided into training and testing sets and label it. 80-20 split generally.
- Building a model:
    We first have to decide what type of model works best for our situation.
    Then, we have to implement the model by constructing a computational graph.
    This graph will contain all of the operations used to process the input and produce a useful output.
    It is a network of interconnected nodes that hold values or operations and maps pathways from inputs to outputs.
    The graph is here all of the calculation happens and pruces the results(hopefully) that we want.
- Training the model:
    We run the training data through our model and compare the model's output to the expected results.
    The total difference between the expected answer and the model output- THE LOSS
    Generally we try to minimise this as it means we are getting closer to the expected answer.
    We use optimisation functions to later values within the graph as the model trains to minimise loss.
    Supervised learning - We teach the model which outputs map to certain inputs.
    The model changes it's values to try to match the input-output mapping we have established
    If we are happy with the results, we continue to testing phase.
    If not, we adjust parameters within the model or fetch more data and continue the training process.
- Testing the model:
    We then measure how well our model performs on data that is has never seen before.
    If we are happy with the results ( loss, accuracy, etc.) then we have a completed model!
    For example: with image classification; we want to map the outputs to labels that categorise each input image.
