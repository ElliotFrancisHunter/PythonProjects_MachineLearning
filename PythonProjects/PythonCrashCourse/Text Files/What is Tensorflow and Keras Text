What is Tensorflow?

- Tensorflow is a high level library for numerical computation( particularly for machine learning).
- It is written in C++ but we can access it using Python.
- It allows us to quickly and fairly easily build, train and test machine learning models.
- However, we have to explicitly build each layer and manually build training and testing loops and optimisers.
- Flexible and easy to use but Keras is much easier


What is Keras?

- Keras is a high level machine learning API(Application program interface)
    that works on top of other machine learning frameworks
- We will use it on top of the Tensorflow framework
- It is easier to use than basic Tensorflow
- More user friendly
- Simpler system
- Build models with ease. add largely by simply creating layer objects and adding them to the model
- Train, test and predict with models simply by calling built in functions
- Easily integrate GPU
